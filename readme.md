File Vault is a full-stack web application designed for secure file storage and sharing. It features a robust end-to-end encryption model that ensures user files and passwords are encrypted on the client-side before ever being transmitted to the server.

Project Description
What It Is

File Vault is a personal cloud storage solution where security is the top priority. Users can register, log in, upload files, manage them, and share them via public links. The core principle is that all sensitive data is encrypted and decrypted exclusively on the client's machine, making it a secure vault for files.

How It's Implemented

The application is built with a modern tech stack and a multi-layered cryptographic model to ensure end-to-end security.

Technology Stack:

Backend: Written in Go, providing a performant and compiled API. It handles user authentication, file metadata management, and serves encrypted file blobs.

Frontend: A responsive single-page application built with React. It manages all client-side logic, including the crucial encryption and decryption processes using crypto-js and node-forge.

Database: PostgreSQL is used to store user metadata, file metadata (like hash and ownership), and access permissions. The actual file content is also stored as encrypted blobs in the database.

Deployment: The entire stack is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose, allowing for easy setup and deployment.

Security Architecture:
The application's security relies on a combination of asymmetric (RSA) and symmetric (AES) encryption.

Password & Credential Encryption: When a user registers or logs in, their password is not sent directly. Instead, the client fetches the server's public RSA key and encrypts the credentials payload with it. The server then decrypts this with its private key. This protects user passwords during the authentication phase.

Session & Payload Encryption: Upon successful login, a unique AES session key is generated. This key is encrypted and sent to the client, which decrypts it using the user's password. For the rest of the session, all communication payloads (like file lists or access change requests) are encrypted and decrypted using this shared session key, ensuring secure communication.

File Encryption: Before uploading, a file is read into the browser's memory and fully encrypted using the session key. The resulting encrypted blob is what gets sent to the server. The server decrypt and stores this blob. When a user requests a file, the server sends back the encrypted blob, and the client decrypts it in the browser.

Features

End-to-End Encryption (E2EE): The most critical feature. Files are encrypted on the client before upload and decrypted on the client after download.

Zero-Knowledge Architecture: The server has no access to user passwords.

Secure User Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication.

Complete File Management:

Upload, download, and view files securely.

Get a list of all your uploaded files.

Delete files.

File Access Control: Set files as PRIVATE (only accessible to you) or PUBLIC (accessible to anyone with the unique link).

Storage Optimization: Files with identical content are only stored once in the database (data deduplication) to save storage space.

IP-Based Rate Limiting: The backend includes a middleware to protect against brute-force attacks and prevent abuse.

Easy Deployment: Fully containerized with Docker for a one-command setup.
